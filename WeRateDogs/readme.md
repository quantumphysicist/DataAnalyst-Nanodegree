# Data Analysis: WeRateDogs Twitter Archive

We analysed the record of tweets from the account WeRateDogs® (@dog_rates) to discover some interesting insights about dogs and dog-lovers. We accessed the twitter archive for WeRateDogs® prior to August 1st, 2017, analysed those tweets and ran their associated images through a neural network that classifies the breed of dogs. After cleaning the data, we analysed tweets for 2069 dogs. Here are our findings.
